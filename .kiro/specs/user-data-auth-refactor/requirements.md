# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on refactoring and improving the user data management system, cloud database operations, and authentication flow. The current implementation has several issues including incomplete data models, inconsistent error handling, fragmented auth flow, and poor separation of concerns. This refactor will create a clean, maintainable, and robust user authentication and data management system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean and well-structured user data model, so that user information can be consistently managed throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user signs up THEN the system SHALL create a UserModel with uid, name, phoneNumber, email, emergencyContacts, profilePhotoUrl, and createdAt fields
2. WHEN user data is stored THEN the system SHALL use consistent field names across local storage and Firestore
3. WHEN user data is retrieved THEN the system SHALL provide proper null safety and validation
4. WHEN user data is updated THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity across all storage locations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want my account data to be properly saved to Firestore during signup, so that I can access my information from any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes signup THEN the system SHALL save user data to Firestore at users/{uid}/data
2. WHEN saving user data THEN the system SHALL include all required fields: name, phoneNumber, uid, emergencyContacts (empty map), profilePhotoUrl (null), createdAt (timestamp)
3. WHEN user data already exists THEN the system SHALL not overwrite existing data
4. WHEN saving fails THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error messages and retry mechanisms

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want my authentication flow to be seamless and reliable, so that I can easily access my account without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user signs in with existing account THEN the system SHALL retrieve user data from Firestore and populate the global user object
2. WHEN a new user signs up THEN the system SHALL guide them through account setup before accessing main features
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery options
4. WHEN a user signs out THEN the system SHALL clear all user data from memory and local storage

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want my emergency contacts to be properly synchronized between local storage and cloud storage, so that my data is always up-to-date and accessible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN emergency contacts are updated THEN the system SHALL save changes to both Firestore and local storage
2. WHEN the app starts THEN the system SHALL load emergency contacts from local storage first, then sync with cloud data
3. WHEN cloud data differs from local data THEN the system SHALL use cloud data as the source of truth
4. WHEN offline THEN the system SHALL use local storage and sync when connection is restored

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and loading states throughout the auth flow, so that users have a smooth experience and issues can be easily debugged.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any database operation occurs THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading indicators
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
3. WHEN operations complete successfully THEN the system SHALL provide confirmation feedback
4. WHEN debugging THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for developers

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want phone number verification to work properly during account setup, so that I can complete my registration successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters their phone number THEN the system SHALL send an OTP to that number
2. WHEN OTP is received THEN the system SHALL verify the code and link it to the user account
3. WHEN verification succeeds THEN the system SHALL update the user's phone number in their profile
4. WHEN verification fails THEN the system SHALL allow retry with clear error messages

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want my profile information to be properly managed and updated, so that my account information stays current and accurate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user updates their name or profile photo THEN the system SHALL save changes to Firestore
2. WHEN profile updates succeed THEN the system SHALL update the local user object and storage
3. WHEN profile photo is uploaded THEN the system SHALL store it in Firebase Storage and save the URL
4. WHEN profile operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and maintain data consistency
